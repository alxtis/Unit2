# AN INTRODUCTION TO CREATIVE COMPUTING WITHIN FASHION
The first thing that comes to your mind when thinking of creative computing isn't necessarily fashion, is it? Overall, the subject seems quite dull and not nearly as exciting as a striking new garment strolling down the fasion runway during the latest season. However, this article will completly change your perspective on technology within fashion and is going to open up a whole new dimension for you to get lost and mesmerised in.

## INTRODUCTION
### BUT WHAT EVEN IS CREATIVE COMPUTING?
Unfortunately, a quick wikipedia search won't give you the answer as it is described quite complicated for someone who is new to the subject. But don't you worry, I am here to break it down for you; it basically refers to the usage of techonolgy within a creative field. However, don't quote me on that! I don't know if that explenation fully covers every aspect of it. However, are beginners, so my explenation will be accurate enough.

### SOUNDS COMPLICATED! HOW IS THAT EVEN APPLICABLE TO FASHION?
I am glad you ask! I am gonna break this article into three subcategories that each explore the usage of technology within fashion in a different way. First, we are gonna talk about how technology can be used to be part of the garment itself. Thinking about it, can the model wearing it be classified as a robot? **Badumtss** Anyway, moving on. Additionally, technology can not only be used on the garments, but also to create the garments. Groundbraking, isn't it? Last but absolutely not least, I am going to talk about the metaverse. In the metaverse you can buy clothing that is only present visually but not physically, almost like in the matrix. 
So buckle up and let's get started!

## WEREABLE TECHNOLOGY
Okay, since we are talking about an absolute massive market here, I chose some examples that I personally find quite interesting to look at. First I wanna talk about a designer called Hussein Chalayan. Not only because he graduated from Central Saint Martins and I like to brag about how I go to the same University as designers that became famous, but also because he is an absolute prime example of someone who creates wearable technology.
