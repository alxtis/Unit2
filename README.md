# ASCII FASHION PROJECTION

## APPROACH

Having been introduced to this brief, I was immediatly concerned about having to deal with yet another project that wouldn't allow me to explore the field I am interested in. However, I quickly decided to get inventive in finding a way on introducing creative computing to the fashion community. Something that immediatly had me hooked during the presentation on monday was the creation of ASCII (American Standart Code for Information Interchange) art and the textures ASCII generators create. Therefore, I went out and got pictures of as many textures as I possibly could in order to eventually print their ASCII rendering onto fabric.

## RESEARCH

During my intial process I came across the designer duo Viktor & Rolf and their 2002 fashion show "long live the immaterial". The fashion show consisted of all-black outfits with hints of royal blue such as the collar, pockets, belts or patterns. As mesmerasing the cloting was, the intriguing part of the show was the very well thought through backdrop. A live-performance of the show was projected onto the backdrop and the royal blue got replaced by different visuals much like as you would expect when using a greenscreen. The entire show was a discussion on what is and what is not, what remains when you remove and how perceptions can be changed.
